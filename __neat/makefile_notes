# Automatic variables:
# --------------------
# Suppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a ‘.c’ file
# into a ‘.o’ file: how do you write the ‘cc’ command so
# that it operates on the right source file name? You cannot write
# the name in the recipe, because the name is different each time
# the implicit rule is applied.
#
# What you do is use a special feature of make, the automatic
# variables. These variables have values computed afresh for each rule that is
# executed, based on the target and prerequisites of the rule. In this
# example, you would use ‘$@’ for the object file name and ‘$<’
# for the source file name.

# each line is run by a separate shell, so this variable
# will not survive to the next line, so you must then use
# it immediately
#
# Shell function:
# https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Shell-Function.html
# The shell function is unlike any other function other than the wildcard
# function (see The Function wildcard) in that it communicates with the world
# outside of make.

# GNU make feature:
# Secondary expansions always take place within the scope of the automatic variables
# for that target. This means that you can use variables such
# as $@, $*, etc. during the second expansion and they will
# have their expected values, just as in the recipe. All
# you have to do is defer the expansion by escaping the $.

# They are expanded at the time make checks the prerequisites of a target.
.SECONDEXPANSION:
# Commands and flags
# uh what does this do
# man gcc | less "+/^\s*-rdynamic"
