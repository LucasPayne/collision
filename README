Preliminaries to a collision detection engine (or whatever else). Learning OpenGL, structuring a project,
more C.

Currently working on an entity system.

Then, a basic polygon editor using this entity system, UI utilities, and integrate into file explorer
to quickly edit polygon data, so a start to a "game editor".

build/poly_view is the start of this, a rudimentary viewer for polygons. Polygons can also be read from ascii-grid files.
